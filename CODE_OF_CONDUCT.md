# Community Guidelines

We want this project to be a productive and respectful place for everyone who contributes in good faith.

## Our Goal

Build great software together, help each other improve, and keep the atmosphere friendly without unnecessary drama.What We Expect

- Be civil and professional.
- Focus feedback on code and ideas, not on the person.
- Assume good intent until proven otherwise.
- Feel free to disagree — just do it respectfully.
- Humor and strong opinions are welcome as long as they don’t cross into personal attacks.

## What’s Not Okay

- Threats or harassment of any kind
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent
- Sustained personal attacks or insults
- Spam or disruptive off-topic posting

## How Issues Are Handled

1. If something crosses the line, a maintainer will reach out privately and ask you to stop.
2. If it continues, we may temporarily restrict your ability to post or comment.
3. Repeated or severe violations will result in a permanent ban.

We’ll always try to handle things quietly, fairly, and with as little public spectacle as possible.

## Reporting Serious Problems

If you ever feel physically threatened or believe someone is in real danger, please contact law enforcement immediately.

For everything else that violates these guidelines, you can reach the maintainers at wassermana@gmail.com (mailto:wassermana@gmail.com). Reports are kept confidential.

That’s all. Let’s keep things kind, keep shipping code, and have some fun along the way.
